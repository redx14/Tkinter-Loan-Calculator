# Tkinter-Loan-Calculator
Allows user to input multiple different loans at time and provide how much they can pay monthly. The program will generate a file that will break down how long it will take to pay off each loan, total interest that will be paid over the total length of the loan, and provide insight on which loan should be paid off first based on the interest.
